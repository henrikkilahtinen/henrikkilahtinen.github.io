         I work in client teams as a Marketing Automation Specialist, mainly with Adobe Campaign Classic. My role includes technological duties associated with implementing and operating a Marketing Automation System such as design, planning, development, management, maintenance as well as supporting the client.

         Adobe Campaign Classic is very comprehensive and feature-rich as a Marketing Automation tool. That means that I have acquired many new skills over the years. I have been technical lead on various projects including data model planning, ETL processes, data management, API integrations/API development, WebApp development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PostgreSQL) and Email Content Manager development (XML/JavaScript/HTML/CSS). 
         
         I also have strengthened my skills in JavaScript and SQL (PostgreSQL)
